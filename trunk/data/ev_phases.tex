 Evolutionary phases defined in the isochrones:
0: main sequence
1: sub giant branch
2: red giant branch
3: red horizontal branch / red clump (core He burning)
4: early asymptotic giant branch
5: thermally-pulsating AGB (composition sets C-rich vs. O-rich)
6: Post-AGB
7: blue stragglers
8: blue horizontal branch
9: Wolf-Rayet (composition sets WC vs. WN)
-1: transition from RGB tip to HB
