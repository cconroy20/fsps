SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1.   edit your .cshrc (or .bashrc) file to something like:
     	  setenv SPS_HOME /home/user/fsps/
	  (this should point to the directory containing the src directory)

2.  edit the makefile in the src directory so that it is using your
    fortran compiler one should then be able to compile everything by
    simply typing "make"

3.  email cconroy@cfa.harvard.edu so that I can keep you posted on updates.  
      -> this step is actually important!  Every code has bugs.  If I
	 don't know that you're using this code, I can't tell you
	 that I found a catastrophic bug that invalidates all of your
	 results.

4.  please email me if have any problems or find any bugs.

NOTES:

1.  It has been reported that the code crashes if compiled with
    earlier versions of gfortran (specifically v4.2.1).  The code has
    been tested and compiles sucessfully with gfortran v4.4 and later.
    (FYI, I currently compile FSPS with gfortran v4.9.0).
