SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1.   edit your .cshrc (or .bashrc) file to something like:
     	  setenv SPS_HOME /home/directory/for/SPS/routines/ 
	  (this should point to the directory containing the src directory)

2.  edit the makefile in the src directory so that it is using your
    fortran compiler one should then be able to compile everything by
    simply typing "make"

3.  email cconroy@ucolick.org so that I can keep you posted on updates.  
      ->  this step is actually important.  Every code has bugs.  If I don't know 
	  that you're using this code, I can't tell you that I found a catastrophic 
	  bug that invalidates all of your results!

4.  please email me if have any problems or find any bugs.

5.  Note that the spectral libraries included here are in binary
    form. The files are written in little endian format (appropriate
    for most machines, like Intel, but not for e.g. PowerPC and Sun
    systems). If you're running the code on a machine that assumes big
    endianness, then you'll have to swap the bytes!  Email me if this
    is a problem for you.

----------------------------------

NOTES:

1.  It has been reported that the code crashes if compiled with
    earlier versions of gfortran (specifically v4.2.1).  The code compiles 
    sucessfully with gfortran v4.4 and later.
