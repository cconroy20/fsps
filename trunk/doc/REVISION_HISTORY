REVISION HISTORY

01/10/09 
 - Release of FSPS v0.9

1/18/09
 - small bug in compsp.f90 fixed.  effected tabulated SFH outputs

1/24/09
 - Bug fixed in the output of *spec files (only effects readin from read_spec.pro)
 - Allowed tau to be less than 0.1.  Minor modifications to compsp.f90
 - Added lesssimple.f90 routine
 - Updated the manual	      	 

4/29/09
 - Release of v1.0
 - Bug in BaSeL library fixed.  Effected primarily red/near-IR colors at 
   the 0.05 mag level.
 - dust attenuation can now be applied to SSPs (i.e. when sfh=0), when 
   dust is turned on
 - greatly increased flexibility in the dust model
   	   - Added Calzetti et al. 2000 attenuation curve
	   - Several additional parameters were added to the parameter set to control
	      various aspects of the dust model.  See the manual for details
 - WFPC2 F606W filter was added.   If you have added filters to the FILTER_LIST file
    you will have to probably contact me to resolve the conflict.

11/17/09 
 - Release of v2.0.  Major revisions, including a calibration of the
   TP-AGB parameters Delta_L and Delta_T on Magellanic Cloud data.  See
   Conroy & Gunn 2009 for details.
 - BaSTI isochrones added
 - Post-AGB tracks added
 - Witt & Gordon 2000 dust models added
 - Routines for computing spectral indices, and velocity broadening
   added
 
02/10/10
 - Release of v2.2.  Major revisions, including the addition of synthetic 
   post-AGB spectra from Rauch 2003, synthetic OB and WR spectra from 
   Smith et al. 2002, and the Geneva models for massive stars (>70 Msun).  
   This means that the model predictions are now more accurate at very early
   ages and in the UV.
 - The directory structure has been reorganized.
 - The code is now in a svn repository for easy future updates
 - There was a bug in compsp that effected early ages.  
 - The time array is now finer, and can be easily modified to be even finer
 - new IMF option: imf_type=5, which allows for tabulated piece-wise power-law IMFs
 - the Miles spectral library is now fully embedded in FSPS
 - the variable Tuniv is now no longer used in setting SFHs.  The final age output
   is now set by the maximum age in the isochrones (unless the parameter tage is set).

09/30/10

 - Release of v2.3.  Major update including the addition of dust emission models 
   from Draine & Li 2007.  The wavelength grid has been expanded to accomodate this
   new feature.
 - Addition of many filters, including many in the IR and submm.
 - The empirical Carbon star spectra are now extrapolated beyond 2.4um with the 
   Aringer et al. 2009 synthetic stellar library.
 - The empirical M star spectra are now extrapolated beyond 2.4um with the latest
   PHOENIX theoretical stellar library (the BT-SETTL grid).
 - Switching between different isochrones and stellar libaries is now more transparent
   in the sps_vars.f90 module.

XX/XX/XX

 - Release of v2.4.  
 - Bug found related to post-AGB stars.  This was affecting far-UV spectra at old ages.
