REVISION HISTORY

1/14/09
 - small bug in compsp.f90 fixed.  effected tabulated SFH outputs

1/24/09
 - Bug fixed in the output of *spec files (only effects readin from read_spec.pro)
 - Allowed tau to be less than 0.1.  Minor modifications to compsp.f90
 - Added lesssimple.f90 routine
 - Updated the manual	      	 

4/29/09
 - Bug in BaSeL library fixed.  Effected primarily red/near-IR colors at 
   the 0.05 mag level.
 - dust attenuation can now be applied to SSPs (i.e. when sfh=0)
 - greatly increased flexibility in the dust model
   	   - Added Calzetti et al. 2000 attenuation curve
	   - Several additional parameters were added to the parameter set to control
	      various aspects of the dust model.  See the manual for details
 - WFPC2 F606W filter was added.   If you have added filters to the FILTER_LIST file
    you will have to probably contact me to resolve the conflict.

11/17/09 
 - Release of v2.0.  Major revisions, including a calibration of the
   TP-AGB parameters Delta_L and Delta_T on Magellanic Cloud data.  See
   Conroy & Gunn 2009 for details.
 - BaSTI isochrones added
 - Post-AGB tracks added
 - Witt & Gordon 2000 dust models added
 - Routines for computing spectral indices, and velocity broadening
   added
 
02/10/20
 - Release of v2.1.  Major revisions, including the addition of synthetic 
   post-AGB spectra from Rauch 2003, synthetic OB and WR spectra from 
   Smith et al. 2002, and the Geneva models for massive stars (>70 Msun).
 - The time array has been substantially modified at early times, and the
   model outputs should be much more reliable/accurate at log(t/yrs)<6.6
 - The directory structure has been reorganized.
 - The code is now in a svn repository for easy future updates
