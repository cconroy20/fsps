-------------------------REVISION HISTORY-----------------------------

** Note that this file details only major revisions and version updates 
   to the code.  The GitHub repository contains more detail regarding 
   minor changes and updates.

01/10/09 
 - Release of FSPS v0.9

1/18/09
 - small bug in compsp.f90 fixed.  Affected tabulated SFH outputs.

1/24/09

 - Bug fixed in the output of *spec files (only effects readin from
   read_spec.pro)
 - Allowed tau to be less than 0.1.  Minor modifications to compsp.f90
 - Added lesssimple.f90 routine
 - Updated the manual	      	 

4/29/09
 - Release of v1.0
 - Bug in BaSeL library fixed.  Effected primarily red/near-IR colors
   at the 0.05 mag level.
 - dust attenuation can now be applied to SSPs (i.e. when sfh=0), when
   dust is turned on
 - greatly increased flexibility in the dust model: Added Calzetti et
   al. 2000 attenuation curve; Several additional parameters were
   added to the parameter set to control various aspects of the dust
   model.  See the manual for details
 - WFPC2 F606W filter was added.  If you have added filters to the
   FILTER_LIST file you will have to probably contact me to resolve
   the conflict.

11/17/09 

 - Release of v2.0.  Major revisions, including a calibration of the
   TP-AGB parameters Delta_L and Delta_T on Magellanic Cloud data.
   See Conroy & Gunn 2009 for details.
 - BaSTI isochrones added
 - Post-AGB tracks added
 - Witt & Gordon 2000 dust models added
 - Routines for computing spectral indices, and velocity broadening
   added
 
04/15/11

 - Release of v2.2.  Major revisions, including the addition of
   synthetic post-AGB spectra from Rauch 2003, synthetic OB and WR
   spectra from Smith et al. 2002, and the Geneva models for massive
   stars (>70 Msun).  This means that the model predictions are now
   more accurate at very early ages and in the UV.
 - The directory structure has been reorganized.
 - The code is now in a svn repository for easy future updates
 - There was a bug in compsp that effected early ages.
 - The time array is now finer, and can be easily modified to be even
   finer
 - new IMF option: imf_type=5, which allows for tabulated piece-wise
   power-law IMFs
 - the Miles spectral library is now fully embedded in FSPS
 - the variable Tuniv is now no longer used in setting SFHs.  The
   final age output is now set by the maximum age in the isochrones
   (unless the parameter tage is set).

09/30/11

 - Release of v2.3.  Major update including the addition of dust
   emission models from Draine & Li 2007.  The wavelength grid has
   been expanded to accomodate this new feature.
 - Addition of many filters, including many in the IR and submm.
 - The empirical carbon star spectra are now extrapolated beyond 2.4um
   with the Aringer et al. 2009 synthetic stellar library.
 - The empirical M star spectra are now extrapolated beyond 2.4um with
   the PHOENIX theoretical stellar library (the BT-SETTL grid).
 - Switching between different isochrones and stellar libaries is now
   more transparent in the sps_vars.f90 module.

06/14/13

 - Release of v2.4.  
 - Bug found related to post-AGB stars.  This was affecting far-UV
   spectra at old ages.
 - MILES library is now combined with BaSeL so that when the MILES
   spectral library is used, the wavelengths are extended beyond the
   nominal MILES limits with the BaSeL grid.
 - Bug fixed related to user-defined tabulated IMF.
 - Bug fixed related to normalization of Spitzer MIPS magnitudes
 - When the "zred" (redshift) flag is non-zero, the output spectra are
   now redshifted, in addition to the magnitudes
 - Spectra can now be smoothed by a Gaussian in velocity space.  This
   is now a parameter in the main parameter set.
 - Major update to the filter set (see the file FILTER_LIST in the
   data directory for details).  Many new HST filters have been added,
   and the ordering of the filters has changed compeletely.  Please
   keep this in mind when reading the *mags file!  If you use the
   read_mags.pro routine provided with FSPS to read in the *mags files
   then you will notice no change except the increased number of
   available filters.

4/17/14

 - Release of v2.5
 - Many updates to the internal workings of the code to increase performance
 - Bugs fixed related to post-AGB stars and to the flux normalization at
   the very youngest ages
 - A new print option in compsp allows users to print the time-dependent CMD
   in all the filters.  New IDL routine read_cmd.pro is included.
 - Smoothing can now be implemented in wavelength or velocity space
 - Added additional filters, including the Stromgren system
 - Implementation of Wolf-Rayet stars has changed.  We now include WC stars
   and metallicity dependence of both WN and WC spectra.
 - Allow dust emission to be self-consistently re-absorbed (previously there 
   was an artificial discontinuity at 1um for very large dust optical depths)
 - Nebular emission (both continuum and line) has been implemented, based on
   lookup tables from Cloudy (courtesy of Nell Byler).  This is off by default
 - Circumstellar dust around AGB stars is now included, as described in detail
   in Villaume et al. (2014).  This is turned on by default
 - Bug fixed related to the wavelengths in the allindices.dat file (an air-vac
   conversion was missing).  New option to output wavelengths in air, rather
   the default, which is vacuum.
 - Added IGM absorption option a la Madau (1995) prescription
 - Added the sf_trunc variable to work for all parameterized SFHs
 - Added the distance modulus and a missing -2.5log(1+z) factor to the 
   computed magnitudes in the case where a non-zero redshift is specified

11/17/15

 - Release of v2.6
 - Geneva isochrone database added (these are older Geneva models)
 - added additional photometric filters
 - fixed various bugs related to star formation truncation options

05/28/16

 - Release of v3.0
 - MIST and PARSEC isochrones added
 - New version of compsp routine that is much faster and more accurate.
   This obviates the need for the time_res_incr parameter
 - AGN dust models of Nenkova et al. 2008 added
 - Added additional filters, including NEWFIRM, Suprime-Cam, VISTA-VIRCAM
 - Fixed a minor bug in the write_isochrone routine related to BHB and BS stars

 - Release of v3.1
 - major bug in tabulted SFHs identified and resolved
 - New WMBasic O star grid courtesy of JJ Eldridge, Mason Ng, and Georgie Taylor
 - Nebular emission (line and continuum) based on Cloudy tables provided by Nell Byler

04/2/21
 - Release of v3.2
 - added THEMIS dust emission model
